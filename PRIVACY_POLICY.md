## 4. Information Collection

### 4.1 Personal Information Collected

The Service collects and processes the following categories of personal information:

- **Password:** Collected for account authentication purposes. Passwords are never stored in plain text format and are securely hashed using the **Argon2id** cryptographic algorithm, which is an industry-standard password hashing function.

**Security Note:** The Argon2id algorithm is designed to resist both side-channel attacks and time-memory trade-off attacks, providing robust protection for stored password credentials.
