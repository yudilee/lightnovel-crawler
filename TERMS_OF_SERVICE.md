If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any content made available through the Service infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our designated copyright agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) for further detail):

6. **Accuracy Statement:** A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Important:** Knowingly materially misrepresenting that material or activity is infringing may subject you to liability for damages, including costs and attorney's fees, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).

### 7.5 Processing of DMCA Takedown Notices

Upon receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice that substantially complies with the requirements set forth in Section 7.4:

1. **Review:** We will review the notice to ensure it contains all required elements and is properly formatted.

2. **Removal:** If the notice is valid and complete, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material, typically within 48 hours of receipt of a valid notice.

3. **User Notification:** We will notify the user who posted or stored the content that the material has been removed or disabled, and provide them with a copy of the takedown notice (with your contact information redacted if requested for privacy reasons).

4. **No Guarantee:** While we strive to process valid notices promptly, we do not guarantee any specific timeframe for removal. Processing time may vary based on the completeness of the notice and other factors.

### 7.6 Counter-Notification Procedure

If you are a user whose content has been removed or disabled as a result of a DMCA takedown notice, and you believe that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(g).

#### 7.6.1 Counter-Notification Requirements

To be effective, a counter-notification must be a written communication provided to our designated copyright agent that includes substantially the following (see 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(3)):

1. **Physical or Electronic Signature:** Your physical or electronic signature.

2. **Identification of Removed Material:** Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.

3. **Good Faith Statement:** A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

4. **Contact Information:** Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States, for any judicial district in which the Service may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.

4. **No Guarantee:** We do not guarantee that material will be restored, and restoration is subject to the original complaining party not filing a court action within the specified timeframe.

**Important:** Knowingly materially misrepresenting that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may subject you to liability for damages, including costs and attorney's fees, under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).
